## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Problem**: Predict `RainTomorrow` based on 20+ meteorological features.
- **Model**: XGBoost Classifier with Label Encoding for categorical features.
- **UI**: Simple Flask Web Interface for input and prediction.
- **Deployment**:
  - Containerized with Docker
  - Deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
  - Automated using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
